1. All dice selected warning appears when not all dice are selected, example case - high grey picked n first roll, removes all except one (non-white) dice.
2. If no dice left on mat after 2nd turn, turn counter doesn't move on.
3. Conversely to 2, sometimes dice are left and 'all dice selected' comes up on reroll.
4. Achieving the yellow bonus on the blue track doesn't highlight the yellow track (perhaps sequencing leaves an unselectAll after the highlightYellow).
