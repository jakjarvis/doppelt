1. All dice selected warning appears when not all dice are selected, example case - high grey picked n first roll, removes all except one (non-white) dice.
2. If no dice left on mat after 2nd turn, turn counter doesn't move on.
3. Conversely to 2, sometimes dice are left and 'all dice selected' comes up on reroll.
